# Risin'
## About Our Project

Risin' is an alarm clock that adapts to your schedule. It changes your alarm based on how fast you turn it off. We made this with Flutter and Dart.

Our app is harvest themed by helping farmers wake up to harvest their crops.


## How To Run
1. First, install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Once you've installed Flutter, clone the repository into your code editor.
3. Run the app and you should be good to go.

## Sympathy System
The sympathy for your alarms is based on the time period you turn it off. For example, if you were to snooze your alarm 1 minute after it goes off, the niceness scale decreases. This decrease changes the sound of your next upcoming awakening alarm to be louder. This uses the idea of punishment and reinforcement.
