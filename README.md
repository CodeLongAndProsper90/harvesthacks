# Risin'

Risin' is an alarm clock that adapts to your schedule. It changes your alarm based on how fast you turn it off. We made this with Flutter and Dart.

## Sympathy System
The sympathy for your alarms are based on the time period you turn it off. So for example, if you were to snooze your alarm for 1 minute after it goes off, the niceness scale decreases. This decrease changes the sound of your next upcoming awakening alarm.  This uses the idea of punishment and reinforcement.
